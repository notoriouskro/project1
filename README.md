Purpose
This application provides a person the ability to search for US National Parks, and retrieve information such as a description, web site, location, and current weather. In addition, the user can register with the site, and after build an itinerary of park visits including start and end date. The itinerary will show a weather forecast for the itinerary dates.

In addition to the general park information, the site also provides information on trails local to the park.
